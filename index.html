        <div class="header"><h1>Hi!</h1></div>
        <div class="title"><h2>My name is Dorin Constantin Banu and this site is about my journey of self-taught web developement. <br>
        No, Im not a narcissist. Why do you ask?</h2></div>
        
        <div class="para">
            <p class="space">I'm going to try and make this short and sweet. So I started with The Complete Web Developer in 2021: 
            Zero to Mastery by Andrei Neagoie and The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021 
            by Colt Steele.
            And while their Udemy courses were good at explaining concepts, 
            when I wanted to build a website from zero I draw a blank in my 
            mind, I didn't know were to start and what to do.
            <p class="space"> After that experience I continued with the courses but felt 
            kinda defeated but in my research I came across a website that 
            claims to teach you real world coding and not just bits and 
            pieces, and it was called The Odin Project.
             I saw that, compared to the Udemy courses, the Odin Project 
            does not hold your hand, it show you how a concept is implemented 
            and then it throws you in the ring to build with it, no hand 
            holding, just coding.</p>
            <p class="space">
            While completing the lessons in The Odin Project it was obvious that 
            I started to understand the concepts and if I was asked 
            to build something I wasn't a chicken without a head, 
            I knew what I had to do to finish the assigment that was given 
            to me.
            At first it was hard, really hard, but I pushed through and gained 
            knowledge and I trully understood that you learn to build websites 
            by building them, not only going through tutorial after tutorial 
            in an endless circle.
            What I learned so far, HTML5 CSS5 JavaScript Git and GitHub, I can 
            confidently say that it was down to The Odin Project.</p>
            <p class="space">As I move forward and keep learning my current goal is to finish 
            The Odin Project and then start learning WordPress and PHP8.
            It's going to be an interesting journey. 
            I want to continue learning and become better at coding.
            Well, as I go through proof reading this it's blatantly obvious 
            it wasn't that short as I stated at the start but I hope 
            it was at least sweet.
